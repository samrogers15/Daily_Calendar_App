# Daily Calendar Application
> This program allows a user to put together a schedule of their daily tasks. The program displays the time of day at that current moment and keeps a running tally of the time as it continues to pass. If a user enters in a specific calendar item and clicks the save button, the text content of that calendar item gets saved to the user's local storage. Upon refreshing the page, the calendar item will still be saved on the calendar (it will only disappear if the user clears their browser's local storage). Additionally, the formatting of the schedule will update as the hours in the day pass by - future calendar items will have a different format than calendar items in the past. Additinoally, calendar items that are reflective of the current hour also have a different format.
